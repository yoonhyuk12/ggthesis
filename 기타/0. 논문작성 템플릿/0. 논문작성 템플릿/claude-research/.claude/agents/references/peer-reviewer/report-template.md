# Peer Review Report Template

After collecting all sub-agent reports, synthesise everything into the final referee report. This is YOUR job as the orchestrator — you integrate the sub-agent findings with your own reading.

## Report Location

Save the report to:

```
reviews/<paper_slug>/peer-reviewer/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md
```

where `<paper_slug>` is the slug of the paper being reviewed (passed to you in the dispatch prompt or read from the INDEX Paper column). Create the `reviews/<paper_slug>/peer-reviewer/` directory if it does not exist. Do NOT overwrite previous reports — each review is timestamped uniquely.

## Novelty Assessment: Detailed Guidance

Novelty is the single most important dimension for a peer review. A methodologically sound paper with no novel contribution should still be rejected. The Novelty & Literature Assessor sub-agent handles the search, but YOU must make the final judgement. Here is your framework:

### What Counts as Novel

| Level | Description | Typical Verdict |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Genuinely new question** | Nobody has asked this question before | Strong accept signal |
| **New method for known question** | Known question, but a methodologically superior approach | Accept if the improvement is material |
| **New data for known question** | Known question and method, but applied to new/better data | Acceptable if the data adds meaningful insight |
| **New context** | Known finding replicated in a different setting | Acceptable only if the setting matters theoretically |
| **Incremental extension** | Minor variation on existing work | Weak contribution — needs strong execution |
| **Already done** | Substantially the same paper already exists | Reject unless the authors convincingly differentiate |

### Red Flags for Low Novelty

- Authors avoid citing the most relevant prior work
- The "contribution" is really a methodological tweak with no substantive insight
- The literature review cites only tangentially related work, not direct competitors
- The paper's contribution could be summarised as "we did X but with different data"
- The paper lacks a clear articulation of what specifically is new

### What the Sub-Agent Should Find

The Novelty & Literature Assessor should return with:
- A list of the closest prior papers and how they relate
- A per-contribution novelty rating
- Any pre-empting papers that the authors may not have cited

If the sub-agent finds pre-empting work, **this is a major concern** and should be prominently flagged.
