# Journal Referee Profiles

> Used by `referee2-reviewer` and `peer-reviewer` agents to calibrate review intensity and focus.
> When a journal is specified, the reviewer adopts that journal's typical referee perspective.
> Each profile includes a **Referee pool** that weights disposition draws (see `referee-config.md`).

## How to Use

When reviewing with a target journal:
1. Look up the journal below
2. Adjust **domain** focus (what matters most substantively)
3. Adjust **methods** focus (rigour expectations)
4. Ask the journal's **typical concerns** as explicit review questions
5. Weight disposition draws using the **Referee pool** field

When no journal is specified, use generic top-field behaviour with equal disposition weights.

## Economics

**Top-5 General Interest**

### American Economic Review (AER)
**Focus:** All fields — broadest audience
**Bar:** Must interest economists outside your subfield. Big question, clean execution, clear contribution.
**Domain focus:** "Would a labour economist care about this health paper?" Contribution must be broad. Literature positioning against the *general* frontier, not just subfield. Policy implications welcome but not required — insight is enough.
**Methods focus:** Identification must be convincing to non-specialists. Clean, transparent design preferred over technically complex one. Standard errors and robustness should be thorough but not excessive.
**Typical concerns:** "Why should economists outside this field care?" "Is the contribution big enough for AER?" "Is this too narrow/specialised?"
**Referee pool:** CREDIBILITY (high), POLICY (medium), STRUCTURAL (medium), MEASUREMENT (low), THEORY (low), SKEPTIC (low)

### Econometrica (ECMA)
**Focus:** Theoretical and empirical economics with formal rigour
**Bar:** Methodological innovation or empirical work with exceptional identification and formal results.
**Domain focus:** Theoretical contribution valued highly. If empirical, the design must be near-airtight. Formal welfare analysis expected. Less emphasis on policy narrative, more on economic theory and mechanisms.
**Methods focus:** Formal proofs or near-formal arguments expected for key results. Asymptotic properties discussed. Novel estimators should have theoretical justification. Simulation evidence for finite-sample properties.
**Typical concerns:** "Where's the formal result?" "What are the asymptotic properties?" "Is this a methods contribution or an applied contribution?"
**Referee pool:** THEORY (high), STRUCTURAL (high), SKEPTIC (medium), CREDIBILITY (low), MEASUREMENT (low), POLICY (low)

### Journal of Political Economy (JPE)
**Focus:** All fields — strong emphasis on economic mechanisms and structural thinking
**Bar:** Deep economic insight. Values understanding *why* something happens, not just *that* it happens.
**Domain focus:** Mechanism is king. Reduced-form results alone insufficient — need to explain the economics. Structural models or mechanism tests expected. Theoretical framework (even informal) valued.
**Methods focus:** Identification strong, but mechanism evidence equally important. Heterogeneity that illuminates the mechanism. Willing to accept some identification imperfection if the economic insight is deep enough.
**Typical concerns:** "What's the mechanism?" "Can you decompose the effect?" "What does this tell us about economic behaviour?"
**Referee pool:** STRUCTURAL (high), THEORY (high), CREDIBILITY (medium), SKEPTIC (medium), POLICY (low), MEASUREMENT (low)

### Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE)
**Focus:** All fields — prizes compelling narrative and important questions
**Bar:** The question must be important and the answer must surprise.
**Domain focus:** Narrative matters enormously. The paper should read like a story with a punchline. Broad implications. Creative use of data or setting. "Clever" identification valued.
**Methods focus:** Identification must be clean and intuitive — easy to explain. Transparency and simplicity over complexity. Visual evidence (event studies, RD plots) highly valued.
**Typical concerns:** "Is this surprising?" "Does this change how we think about X?" "Can you explain the identification in one sentence?"
**Referee pool:** CREDIBILITY (high), POLICY (high), SKEPTIC (medium), STRUCTURAL (low), THEORY (low), MEASUREMENT (low)

### Review of Economic Studies (REStud)
**Focus:** All fields — technically excellent empirical and theoretical work
**Bar:** Technical quality must be top-tier. Values precision and completeness over narrative.
**Domain focus:** Thoroughness expected — address every possible objection. Complete set of robustness checks. Careful literature review. Less emphasis on storytelling than QJE, more on completeness.
**Methods focus:** Every specification must be justified. Full battery of robustness checks expected. Sensitivity analysis (Oster bounds, etc.). Careful treatment of inference. Multiple testing corrections if applicable.
**Typical concerns:** "Have you checked robustness to X?" "What about specification Y?" "The inference needs more care."
