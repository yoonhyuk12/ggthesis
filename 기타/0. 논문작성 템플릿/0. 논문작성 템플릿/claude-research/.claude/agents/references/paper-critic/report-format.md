# Paper Critic — CRITIC-REPORT.md format

> Full markdown template for the `CRITIC-REPORT.md` artefact. Referenced by `paper-critic.md`.
>
> Write the report to `reviews/<paper>/paper-critic/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md` in the **project root** (the directory containing the `.tex` files, NOT the Task Management directory), where `<paper>` is the paper slug (e.g., `paper-jtp`, `paper-philtech`) passed in your dispatch prompt. Create `reviews/<paper>/paper-critic/` if it does not exist. Do NOT overwrite previous reports — each review is dated. The optional sidecar `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.findings.json` lives in the same `reviews/<paper>/paper-critic/` directory. **Write this AFTER `findings.json` is finalised** (see `json-schema.md`).

## Notes

- The markdown CRITIC-REPORT.md uses human-readable tier names ("Critical"/"Major"/"Minor") in headings. The JSON `findings.json` (see `json-schema.md`) is rigid and uses single-letter codes (`C`/`M`/`m`).
- Both files must agree: same issue count, same IDs, same deductions, same quotes. If they diverge during authoring, `findings.json` is the source of truth.
- The `## Verdict:` line at the top must be parseable verbatim — no prose preamble, no ambiguity. Downstream contract-compliance check (D1) reads it directly.
