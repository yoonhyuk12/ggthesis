# Proposal Review Report Template

After collecting sub-agent reports, synthesise everything into the final feedback report.

## Report Location

Save the report to:

```
reviews/_project/proposal-reviewer/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md
```

Create the `reviews/_project/proposal-reviewer/` directory if it does not exist. Do NOT overwrite previous reports — each review is dated.
