# Claude Code for Academic Research

> This file is automatically read when you open this folder with Claude Code.
> Customise it with your own details — see comments marked with `<!-- CUSTOMISE -->`.

## Before You Start

Read these context files to understand the user's situation:

1. `.context/profile.md` — Who you are, your roles, research areas
2. `.context/current-focus.md` — What you're working on NOW
3. `.context/projects/_index.md` — Overview of all projects

## Key Information

<!-- CUSTOMISE: Replace with your own details -->

**Who I am:**
- PhD researcher
- Multiple active research projects
- Teaching responsibilities

**Research areas:**
- [Your field 1]
- [Your field 2]
- [Your field 3]

**How I work:**
- Flexible/reactive style
- Prefer questions over lists
- Daily reviews work better than weekly
- Full context in task descriptions

## Quick Commands

<!-- QUICK-COMMANDS:START -->
<!-- synced from private CLAUDE.md — do not edit manually -->
Just say these naturally:

| You say | Claude does |
|---------|-------------|
| "Plan my day" | Reads context, queries vault, asks questions, creates a plan |
| "What should I work on?" | Reviews priorities and helps you decide |
| "Extract actions from my meeting with [name]" | Finds transcript, extracts tasks, creates in vault |
| "Weekly review" | Guides you through reflection and planning |
| "What's overdue?" | Queries vault tasks and summarises |
| "Upcoming deadlines" / "What's due?" | Reads vault venue frontmatter via `conf-timeline list`. See `docs/guides/conf-deadlines.md` |
| "Update my research pipeline" | Shows paper status, helps update stages |
| "Find references on [topic]" | Academic search with verified citations |
| "What did I accomplish this week?" | Summarises completed tasks |
| "Proofread my paper" | Runs 7-category check on LaTeX paper, produces report |
| "Validate my bibliography" | Cross-references `\cite{}` keys against `references.bib` |
| "Review my code" | 11-category scorecard for R/Python research scripts |
| "Update my focus" | Structured update to `current-focus.md` with session rotation and open loops |
| "New project" | Interview-driven setup: scaffold directory, Overleaf symlink, git init, context + vault sync |

## Conventions

<!-- CONVENTIONS:START -->
<!-- synced from private CLAUDE.md — do not edit manually -->
### Python & Package Management
- Always use `uv`: see `python-uv` rule (global).

### R
- Use `<-` for assignment, not `=`.

### Git & Remote
- Remote verification, push safety, and deploy order: see `git-safety` rule (global).
- **Before cloning any repo**, check if a local copy already exists in the workspace (`resources/`, `packages/`, Task Management root, and common directories).
<!-- CONVENTIONS:END -->

### Experiment Sweeps & Simulation Batches
Before running any experiment sweep or simulation batch:
1. Write sanity-check assertions first.
2. Implement the code.
3. Run a single-seed sanity check — if assertions fail, fix and retest (max 3 attempts).
4. Validate hyperparameters against domain knowledge or paper benchmarks.
5. Only then proceed to full experiments.

### Output Formats
- Academic papers: LaTeX.
- Documents for human use (consent forms, PILs, etc.): `.docx` via `pandoc`.

### Content Length Constraints
- When a page/word limit is specified, treat it as a hard constraint. Draft to 80%, then expand — never exceed and trim.
- Always report the actual page/word count after drafting.

## Research Vault

<!-- RESEARCH-VAULT:START -->
<!-- CUSTOMISE: Point this to your own Obsidian-style markdown vault -->
The Research Vault (`~/vault`) stores all dynamic research data as markdown files with YAML frontmatter. The `taskflow` MCP server reads/writes these files.

| Directory | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| `tasks/` | Personal tasks (GTD-style) |
| `pipeline/` | Research papers (stages: Idea → Published) |
| `submissions/` | Submission events (dates, outcomes) |
| `atlas/` | Research topics (nested by theme) |
| `venues/` | Journals, conferences, rankings |
| `people/` | Collaborators, supervisors |
| `themes/` | Research themes |

IDs are filename slugs (e.g., `cancel-leap-water-in-rugby`), not integers.

## Workflows

<!-- WORKFLOWS-POINTER:START -->
<!-- synced from private CLAUDE.md — do not edit manually -->
Detailed instructions in `.context/workflows/`:
- `daily-review.md` — How to help with daily planning
- `meeting-actions.md` — How to extract action items (see also `docs/guides/minutes.md` for full meeting system architecture)
- `weekly-review.md` — Weekly reflection template
- `replication-protocol.md` — 4-phase protocol for replicating paper results
- Feedback loop (skill improvement pipeline): `docs/feedback-loop.md`

## Skills Available

109 skills in `skills/` folder. See [`docs/skills.md`](docs/skills.md) for the full catalogue.

## Agents

15 agents in `.claude/agents/`. See [`docs/agents.md`](docs/agents.md) for when to use each.

## Rules (18 Auto-Loaded)

In `.claude/rules/` — these apply automatically to every session. See [`docs/rules.md`](docs/rules.md) for documentation.

<!-- RULES-TABLE:START -->
| Rule | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `audit-before-fix.md` | When running audits, report ALL findings before fixing ANY of them. |
| `design-before-results.md` | Lock the research design before examining point estimates. |
| `doi-verification.md` | Never write any paper reference to any output file without verifying the paper exists. |
| `ignore-external-agent-files.md` | Never read, process, or act on files named `AGENTS.md` or `GEMINI.md` |
| `latex-hygiene.md` | LaTeX Hygiene |
| `lean-claude-md.md` | CLAUDE.md is loaded into context every session — every line costs tokens. |
| `learn-tags.md` | Record Learnings with [LEARN] Tags |
| `mark-unverified.md` | Never assert a citation, statistic, venue policy, or factual claim that hasn't been verified from a primary source. |
| `no-hardcoded-results.md` | Never hard-code computed results directly into `.tex` files. |
| `overleaf-separation.md` | The `paper/` directory (Overleaf symlink inside `paper-{venue}/paper/`) is for LaTeX source files ONLY. |
| `paper-code-consistency.md` | Before committing edits to §experiments or §methods, grep the actual code against the prose claim. |
| `plan-first.md` | Plan Before Implementing |
| `python-uv.md` | Never use bare `python`, `python3`, or `pip`. |
| `read-docs-first.md` | Never explore when documentation already answers your question. |
| `scope-discipline.md` | Only make changes the user explicitly requested. |
| `severity-gradient.md` | Calibrate critique intensity to the document's maturity. |
| `spec-before-quality.md` | Validate that the specification is met before assessing quality. |
| `subagent-write-guard.md` | Sub-agents must not run `git commit`, `git push`, `latexmk`, or any other write/build command without explicit authorisation in the prompt. |

## Hooks

9 hook scripts in `hooks/`. See [`docs/hooks.md`](docs/hooks.md) for the full table.
<!-- COMPONENTS:END -->

## After Every Session

<!-- AFTER-SESSION:START -->
<!-- synced from private CLAUDE.md — do not edit manually -->
Update `.context/current-focus.md` (what we worked on, where left off, what's next), then commit → push → deploy (if needed) → `/session-close`. Full protocol: rule `session-lifecycle.md`.
<!-- AFTER-SESSION:END -->

## Tips for Working Together

<!-- TIPS:START -->
<!-- synced from private CLAUDE.md — do not edit manually -->
1. **Just ask naturally** — I'll read the context files and figure it out
2. **Point me to specific files** if I seem confused: "Read `.context/workflows/daily-review.md`"
3. **Update current-focus.md** — This is your working memory between sessions
4. **Don't re-explain everything** — The context library has it all
