# Quality Rubric: Proofread

> Scoring rubric for `/proofread`. Uses the shared framework in [`../../shared/quality-scoring.md`](../../shared/quality-scoring.md).

## Deduction Table

### Blocker (-100)

| Issue | Deduction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Broken `\ref{}` producing `??` in output | -100 | Document has unresolved references — not submission-ready |
| Broken `\cite{}` producing `??` or `[?]` | -100 | Missing bibliography entries — not submission-ready |

### Critical (-15 to -25)

| Issue | Deduction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Inconsistent core notation (e.g., `$x_i$` vs `$x_{i}$` for the same variable) | -15 | Per notation inconsistency pattern |
| Wrong citation command (`\cite` instead of `\citet`/`\citep` throughout) | -15 | Per systematic misuse pattern |
| Major grammar error (subject-verb disagreement, dangling modifier) | -15 | Per instance in body text |
| Major grammar error in abstract or introduction | -15 | Higher visibility = higher cost |

### Major (-5 to -14)

| Issue | Deduction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Informal contraction in body text (don't, can't) | -5 | Per unique contraction |
| Overfull hbox > 10pt | -5 | Per instance |
| Inconsistent citation ordering (mixed chronological/alphabetical) | -5 | Once for the pattern |
| British/American English mixing (systematic) | -5 | Once for the pattern |
| Equation referenced but unnumbered | -5 | Per instance |
| "As shown by (Author, Year)" instead of `\citet{}` | -5 | Per instance |

### Minor (-1 to -4)

| Issue | Deduction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Academic tone slip (casual hedging, exclamation mark) | -3 | Per instance |
| Overfull hbox 1-10pt | -2 | Per instance |
| Minor spelling error (non-technical) | -1 | Per instance |
| Inconsistent tense (isolated, not systematic) | -2 | Per instance |
| Minor spacing or formatting inconsistency | -1 | Per instance |
| Paragraph opens with in-line citation unnecessarily | -2 | Per instance |
| "As shown by \citet{}" where parenthetical fits better | -2 | Per instance |

### Citation Voice Balance (-5 to -10)

| Issue | Deduction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| In-line:parenthetical ratio exceeds 1:1 | -10 | Once for the document — systematic overuse |
| Run of 3+ consecutive in-line citations | -5 | Per run (paragraph or section) |

### Numeric Cross-Check (-5 to -25)

| Issue | Deduction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Text claims a number that contradicts its own table | -25 | Critical — per instance. Embarrassing if caught by a reviewer. |
| Significance claim in text doesn't match stars/p-value in table | -15 | Critical — misleading |
| Sample size (N) inconsistency between text and table | -15 | Critical — per instance |
| N inconsistency across related table specifications (unexplained) | -5 | Major — per table pair |
| Table/figure referenced in text but doesn't exist | -15 | Critical — broken reference |
| Table/figure exists but never referenced in text | -5 | Major — orphaned exhibit |

### Causal Language (-5 to -25)

| Issue | Deduction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Causal claim ("causes", "the effect of") with no identification strategy | -25 | Critical — reviewer will attack this |
| Causal claim that exceeds the stated identification strategy's strength | -15 | Critical — overclaiming |
| Ambiguous "significant" (could be statistical or substantive) | -5 | Major — per instance |
| Coefficient described without units or scale | -5 | Major — per instance |
| Correlation/causation conflation (sliding from association to causal claim) | -15 | Critical |

### Equation Completeness (-5 to -15)

| Issue | Deduction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Variable in equation undefined in surrounding text | -5 | Major — per variable |
| Subscript/index level doesn't match described observation unit | -15 | Critical — conceptual error |
| Inconsistent notation across equations (same concept, different symbol) | -15 | Critical — same as Check 2 but across equations |
| Error term specification inconsistent with described model | -5 | Major |
| Equation cross-reference points to wrong equation | -15 | Critical |

### Preprint Staleness (-5)

| Issue | Deduction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Preprint cited when published version exists | -5 | Major — per instance. Suggest running `/bib-validate` for thorough check. |
