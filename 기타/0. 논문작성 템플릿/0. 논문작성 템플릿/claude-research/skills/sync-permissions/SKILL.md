# Update Rules Skill

> Sync global permissions, skills, and agents into the current project without losing project-specific settings.

## Purpose

The `SessionStart` hook only copies permissions when `.claude/settings.local.json` doesn't exist yet. After that, new global permissions never propagate to existing projects. This skill fills that gap — run it anytime to pull in new permissions additively.

## When to Use

- After adding new permissions to `~/.claude/settings.json`
- When starting work in a project that hasn't been updated in a while
- After creating a new skill and wanting it available everywhere
- When the user says "sync permissions", "update rules", "update my permissions"

## What It Does

1. **Merge permissions** — adds global permissions into project-local, keeping any project-specific ones
2. **Verify skills directory** — ensures `~/.claude/skills/` exists and has content
3. **Verify agents directory** — ensures `~/.claude/agents/` exists and has content
4. **Report changes** — shows exactly what was added

## What It Does NOT Do

- Never removes existing project permissions (additive only)
- Never modifies `~/.claude/settings.json` (reads it, never writes)
- Never touches `model`, `hooks`, or other global settings keys

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Both Permission Files

Read these two files:
- **Global:** `~/.claude/settings.json` → extract `permissions.allow` array
- **Local:** `.claude/settings.local.json` → extract `permissions.allow` array

If the local file doesn't exist, create it with global permissions (same as the SessionStart hook).

### Step 2: Compute the Union

Merge the two permission arrays:
- Start with all existing **local** permissions (preserve everything)
- Add any **global** permissions not already present in local
- Sort the final array for readability

The merge logic:
```
new_permissions = local_permissions ∪ global_permissions
added = new_permissions - local_permissions
```

### Step 3: Write the Merged Result

If there are new permissions to add:
1. Read the full local settings file (preserve any non-permissions keys)
2. Replace `permissions.allow` with the merged array
3. Write back to `.claude/settings.local.json`

If no new permissions, skip the write.

### Step 4: Verify Skills Directory

Check that `~/.claude/skills/` exists and has content:
- If missing or empty, warn: "Skills directory missing — run `sync-to-claude-home.sh` to populate"
- If present, report file count

### Step 5: Verify Agents Directory

Check that `~/.claude/agents/` exists and has content:
- If missing or empty, warn: "Agents directory missing — run `sync-to-claude-home.sh` to populate"
- If present, report file count

### Step 6: Report

Output a summary:

```
Permissions sync complete:
- Global permissions: [N]
- Local permissions (before): [N]
- New permissions added: [N] — [list them]
- Local permissions (after): [N]
- Skills directory: ✓ [N] files / ✗ missing
- Agents directory: ✓ [N] files / ✗ missing
```

If nothing changed:
```
Everything up to date. No new permissions to add. Skills OK. Agents OK.
```

## Example

Running `/sync-permissions` after adding `WebFetch` and `Skill(literature)` to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```
Permissions sync complete:
- Global permissions: 25
- Local permissions (before): 64
- New permissions added: 2 — WebFetch, Skill(literature)
- Local permissions (after): 66
- Skills directory: ✓ 496 files
- Agents directory: ✓ 16 files
```

---

## Safety

- **Additive only** — the skill can only add permissions, never remove them
- **No global writes** — global settings are read-only
- **Directory check** — verifies skills/agents directories exist and have content
- **Idempotent** — safe to run multiple times; re-running with no changes produces no writes
