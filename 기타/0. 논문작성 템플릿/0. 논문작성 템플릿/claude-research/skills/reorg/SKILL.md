name: reorg
description: "Use when you need content-aware file reorganisation or deduplication driven by a LOCAL model (Ollama on the Mac Mini) that actually reads each file's contents, not just its name — proposes a folder structure or finds exact/near duplicates, always dry-runs first, and executes only on approval with a full undo. Triggers: 'reorganise this folder', 'tidy up Downloads with the local model', 'reorg', 'find duplicate files', 'dedup this folder', 'sort these files by reading them'."

# reorg — local-model file reorganiser

Conversational front-end for the `local-reorg` CLI (`scripts/local-reorg/`). The CLI runs a
**local Ollama model on the Mac Mini** that reads each file's content and proposes where it
should go, or finds duplicates. Nothing is ever moved without your approval, and every run
is reversible.

## When to use

- "Reorganise / tidy / sort this folder" where you want the model to **read** files, not
  just pattern-match filenames.
- "Find duplicates" / "dedup this folder" (exact + near-duplicate via embeddings).
- General clutter (Downloads, Desktop, a messy project subfolder).

For research-project *structural* changes use `/rename-project-research` or
`/init-project-research`; for meeting `to-sort/` inboxes the `process-to-sort` rule already
handles it. This skill is general-purpose file tidying.

## How to invoke the CLI

First `hostname`:

- **On the Mac Mini** (`[server]`): the `reorg` shim is on PATH — call `reorg …` directly.
- **Anywhere else** (MacBook, etc.): run it on the Mini over SSH by full path:
  `ssh mini 'python3 ~/.local/share/local-reorg/reorg.py <args>'`

The model + files both live on the Mini, so **give an absolute Mini path**. Translate
Dropbox paths: the MacBook's `~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/…` is the Mini's
`/Volumes/SSD/Dropbox/…`. If the target is a Dropbox path, rewrite the root before passing
it. If you can't resolve the path unambiguously, ask.

## Workflow

1. **Confirm the target folder** and pick a mode with the user if unclear:
   - reorg by scheme: `auto` (default) · `by-type` · `by-topic` · `by-date`
   - dedup: `--dedup` (report) → `--dedup --quarantine` (move redundant copies aside)
2. **Dry-run** — never skip this:
   - reorg: `reorg <folder> [--scheme X] [--recursive]`
   - dedup: `reorg <folder> --dedup`
   The CLI writes `<folder>/.reorg/plan.md` (reorg) or `.reorg/duplicates.md` (dedup).
3. **Read the plan file and summarise it for the user** — group counts, notable moves, and
   any `⚠low-conf` items. Do not dump the whole file; give a scannable summary and the path.
4. **Get approval.** The user may edit `.reorg/plan.json` first (trim/retarget moves).
5. **Execute** only after a clear yes:
   - reorg: `reorg <folder> --apply` (add `--yes` if ≥20 moves — tell the user it's the
     break-the-glass threshold)
   - dedup: `reorg <folder> --dedup --quarantine`
6. **Offer undo**: `reorg <folder> --undo` reverses the most recent applied/quarantined run
   (LIFO). Mention it after any execution.

## Options worth surfacing

- `--model gemma4:e2b` — ~1.5× faster than the default `gemma4:e4b`, slightly less accurate.
  Suggest it for large folders.
- `--max-files N` — default 200; raise for big sweeps (warn about time: ~5–6 s/file on e4b).
- `--dedup-threshold 0.95` — stricter near-match (default 0.92; paraphrases ~0.96).

## Safety (the CLI enforces; restate to the user)

- **Refuses** Overleaf (`Apps/Overleaf/`), the vault (`vault/`), `~/.claude/`, and
  anything under `data/raw/` or `.git/`. Don't try to work around this.
- **Never deletes.** Reorg moves into subfolders; dedup *quarantines* into `.reorg/duplicates/`.
- **git mv** for tracked files; **undo manifest** on every applied run.
- The dry-run → approve → apply loop is mandatory. Do not run `--apply`/`--quarantine`
  before showing the plan and getting a yes.

## Requirements

Ollama must be running on the Mini with `gemma4:e4b` (or the chosen model) + `nomic-embed-text`
for dedup, plus `pdftotext`. All present as of setup. If Ollama is unreachable the CLI exits
with a clear message — relay it rather than guessing.
