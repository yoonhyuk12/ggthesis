# LaTeX Polish — Source Lint + Vision-On-Rendered-PDF

> Heavier-weight visual-quality review than `/latex`. Combines the Phase 4 source-pathology lint with vision-model inspection of selected rendered PDF pages. Designed to catch the failure class that `/latex` Phase 4 source-grep misses: blank pages, clipped tables, illegible shrunken figures, weird title-page line spacing that the regex couldn't fingerprint, bad float placement, overlap.

## When to Use

- Pre-submission visual check on a paper, proposal, thesis, or deck
- After major restructuring (new sections, table re-layouts, figure swaps) when you want eyes on the rendered output
- When `/latex` reports a clean build but something still "looks weird"
- When preparing for a panel / supervisor read where presentation matters

## When NOT to Use

| Need | Use instead |
|------|-------------|
| Compile-fix loop | `/latex` |
| Citation audit | `/latex` (Phase 5) or `/bib-validate` |
| Prose / academic-argument review | `/proofread` |
| Single-figure analysis | `/figure-feedback` |
| Continuous integration | This skill renders + vision-inspects pages; too expensive to run on every save |

## Inputs

- **`.tex` path** — auto-discovered or user-provided. Prefer the user's argument.
- **PDF path** — assumed at `<project>/<basename>.pdf` (per `/latex` convention). If absent or older than `.tex`, the skill aborts and suggests `/latex` first.
- **`--no-vision`** — skip the vision-rendering phases (Page rendering onward), run the source-pathology lint only.
- **`--pages auto|N,N,N`** — page selection override. Default `auto`.

## Hard Rules

1. **Do not compile.** This skill presupposes a clean PDF. If the PDF is missing or stale, abort and suggest `/latex` first.
2. **Read-only with respect to source files.** Exception: Pattern-1 (spacing-hack) opt-in fix, which is offered with a diff and only applied on explicit user yes.
3. **No deploy actions.** This skill produces a report; it does not commit, push, or modify build infrastructure.
4. **Cap render cost.** Max 8 pages rendered per invocation. If page selection would exceed 8, prioritise: title page, worst-overfull page, first table/figure page, then arbitrary sample.
5. **Cap vision-prompt cost.** One Read per rendered page. No per-page back-and-forth.

## Protocol — 7 Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-flight

1. Resolve `.tex` path. If a directory was given, find `main.tex` or single `.tex` inside.
2. Resolve PDF path: `<dirname>/<basename without .tex>.pdf`. If missing or older than `.tex`, abort with: "Stale or missing PDF — run `/latex` first."
3. Verify `pdftoppm` is on PATH. If not, abort with install hint (`brew install poppler` on macOS).
4. Create render dir: `mktemp -d /tmp/latex-polish.XXXXXX`. Track this as `$RENDER_DIR`.

### Phase 2: Source-pathology re-run (Phase 4 of `/latex`)

Run the 9 grep-based source-pathology detectors from `~/.claude/skills/latex/references/source-pathologies.md`, plus `chktex` and `latexindent -k` if installed. Collect findings into a structured list.

This phase is identical to `/latex` Phase 4 and is rerun here for self-containment (so `/latex-polish` can be invoked without a prior `/latex` run).

### Phase 3: Page selection

Determine which pages to vision-inspect. Default `auto`:

| Page | Why | Mandatory if available |
|------|-----|------------------------|
| 1 | Title / cover — high-stakes visual real estate; title-page failure mode is common | Yes |
| Page containing any overfull vbox > 50pt | Vertical overflow is almost always visually broken | Yes |
| Page containing the largest overfull hbox | The "worst" horizontal overflow seen | Yes |
| First page containing a table | Tables produce the most common visual pathologies | Yes |
| First page containing a figure | Same | If figures exist |
| Last body page before bibliography | Catches widow/orphan and end-of-content layout issues | If pages > 5 |
| Bibliography page 1 | Citation formatting + hanging indent regressions | If bib exists |

If overfull-box locations are not known (no log file or out/main.log missing), skip those entries. Cap total at 8 pages; if the selection would exceed 8, drop the lowest-priority entries.

Pull overfull-box page locations by reading `<project>/out/<basename>.log`:

```bash
awk '/Overfull \\(v|h)box/ { for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) if($i ~ /\[[0-9]+\]/) print substr($i,2,length($i)-2) }' out/main.log | sort -u
```

For each candidate page, also record WHY it was selected (used to pick the right vision-prompt later).

### Phase 4: Page rendering

```bash
for P in $SELECTED_PAGES; do
    pdftoppm -r 150 -f $P -l $P -png "$PDF" "$RENDER_DIR/page-$P"
done
```

150 DPI is enough for layout analysis without ballooning file sizes. Each PNG lands at `$RENDER_DIR/page-<N>-<P>.png` (pdftoppm pads the page number).

### Phase 5: Vision analysis

For each rendered page, `Read` the PNG and apply the per-page-type prompt from [`references/vision-prompts.md`](references/vision-prompts.md):

- **Title page** prompt: focuses on alignment, line-spacing consistency, weight hierarchy, vertical block separation, font-size jumps
- **Body page** prompt: focuses on paragraph spacing, hyphenation/justification artefacts, ragged margins, widow/orphan lines, float positioning
- **Table/figure page** prompt: focuses on caption position, alignment with surrounding text, legibility at this rendered size, clipping, awkward whitespace
- **Bibliography page** prompt: focuses on hanging indent, entry alignment, consistent inter-entry spacing
- **General** prompt: catches anything unmatched

Each Read produces a structured finding list per page. Output schema per page:

```
Page N (selection reason: "title page" | "overfull at L<line>" | …):
  - Finding 1: <one-sentence description> [Tier: Major/Moderate/Minor]
  - Finding 2: …
  Verdict: PASS / NOTES / REVISE
```

If `--no-vision` was passed, skip Phases 3–5 entirely.

### Phase 6: Report consolidation

Write the polish report to `<project>/reviews/<paper-slug>/latex-polish/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md` (per `rules/review-artefact-routing.md`), where `<paper-slug>` is the paper being reviewed (e.g. `paper-jtp`, `paper-philtech`):

```markdown
# LaTeX Polish Report — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

**Document:** <path>
**PDF age:** <minutes/hours since last build>
**Pages rendered for vision:** N
**Source detectors run:** 9 grep + chktex + latexindent

## Source pathologies (Phase 2)

<table from Phase 4 spec>

## Per-page vision findings (Phase 5)

### Page 1 — title
<verdict and findings>

### Page <N> — <reason>
<verdict and findings>

...

## Consolidated verdict

PASS / NOTES / REVISE — based on the worst finding tier across both phases.

## Suggested remediations

<prioritised list, max 10 items>
```

### Phase 7: Quality score

Read [`references/quality-rubric.md`](references/quality-rubric.md). Compute deductions across:
- Source-pathology findings (mirrors `/latex` rubric)
- Vision findings (this skill's distinct contribution)

Verdict thresholds per `skills/shared/quality-scoring.md`. Append the Score Block to the report.

## Pattern-1 opt-in auto-fix

If Phase 2 detects a Pattern-1 (spacing-hack) issue, the report includes an `**Offer:**` block:

```markdown
**Offer:** Wrap `<env-name>` in `\begin{singlespace}…\end{singlespace}` and delete the negative kerns at L<N1>, L<N2>. Apply? (Y/N)
```

Wait for explicit user approval. If yes, apply via narrow `Edit` calls and recompile via `latexmk`. If no, leave the report as-is. Do not silently apply.

This is the only auto-fix offered. All other findings are report-only.

## What `/latex-polish` does NOT do

- Compile or fix compile errors (use `/latex` first)
- Modify prose or argument (`/proofread` covers that)
- Audit citations (`/latex` Phase 5 or `/bib-validate`)
- Replace `/figure-feedback` for standalone figure-file analysis
- Auto-commit, auto-push, or modify settings.json / hooks / rules
