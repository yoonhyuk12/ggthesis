# Synthesise Reviews

> Combine multiple review reports into a single prioritised revision plan with cross-reviewer consensus ranking.

## Output Path

Per `rules/review-artefact-routing.md` (auto-loads in research projects (path-scoped to `paper-*/` and `paper/`)):

- **Source slug:** `synthesise-reviews`
- **Write reports to:** `reviews/<scope>/synthesise-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md` inside the project, where `<scope>` is the paper slug (e.g. `paper-jtp`) or `_project` for project-level synthesis. Path is relative to the research project root, not the Task-Management repo.
- **Never** at project root (`./CRITIC-REPORT.md`-style filenames are forbidden — pre-rule layout).
- **Idempotency:** if today's file exists, append a same-day descriptor (`{date}-revision.md`, `{date}-r2.md`, `{date}-pre-submission.md`) — never overwrite.
- **Index update:** if `reviews/INDEX.md` exists, write a one-line entry under "Latest per source" pointing at the new file. Otherwise `/review-recap` will rebuild the index next time it runs.
- **Infrastructure repos** (Task-Management, atlas-workspace, etc.): this section does not apply — the path-scoped rule won't load there.


## Purpose

After running parallel review agents (paper-critic, domain-reviewer, referee2-reviewer), this skill reads all their reports, cross-references issues, and produces a unified `REVISION-PLAN.md` that groups issues into workstreams by priority and theme.

Inspired by APE Papers' `reviewer_response_plan_1.md` pattern — workstreams grouped by priority, each concern traced to its reviewer.

## When to Use

- After running 2+ review agents on a paper
- After a council review round
- When preparing a revision plan from multiple feedback sources
- After receiving referee reports (processed via `/strategic-revision`)

## When NOT to Use

- Before reviews exist — run the review agents first
- To run reviews — use the individual agents (`paper-critic`, `domain-reviewer`, `referee2-reviewer`)
- For a single review — just read the report directly

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discover Reports

Glob for review files in the project root. Scan the new canonical structure first, then fall back to legacy:

```
reviews/<scope>/<check>/YYYY-MM-DD*.md (canonical: e.g. reviews/paper-jtp/paper-critic/2026-06-28-1437.md)
reviews/<check>/YYYY-MM-DD*.md (legacy: e.g. reviews/paper-critic/2026-06-28-1437.md)
```

Where `<scope>` is a paper slug (e.g. `paper-jtp`) or `_project`.

Also check for processed referee comments:

```
docs/venues/*/revision-*/reviewer-comments/comment-tracker.md
```

If no reports found, ask the user where the reports are.

Present the discovered reports and their dates. If reports are from different dates, ask whether to synthesise all or just the most recent round.

### Step 2: Parse Issues

For each report, extract the issue list:

**From paper-critic CRITIC-REPORT.md:**
- Parse the Deductions table (columns: #, Issue, Tier, Deduction, Category, Location)
- Extract Critical (C*), Major (M*), Minor (m*) issue details from the detailed sections

**From domain-reviewer DOMAIN-REVIEW.md:**
- Parse each Lens section's issue table (columns: #, Issue, Severity, Location)
- Map: CRITICAL → Critical, MAJOR → Major, MINOR → Minor

**From referee2-reviewer REFEREE2-REPORT.md:**
- Parse the structured findings from each audit dimension
- Extract severity-tagged issues

**From processed referee comments (comment-tracker.md):**
- Parse the comment tracker table
- Each referee comment becomes an issue with severity from the tracker

### Step 3: Cross-Reference and Consensus Escalation

Match issues across reports by semantic similarity (same underlying problem, possibly described differently):

| Consensus | Priority |
|-----------|----------|
| Flagged by 3/3 reviewers | **Critical** (regardless of individual severity) |
| Flagged by 2/3 reviewers | **Major** (or higher if any reviewer rated Critical) |
| Flagged by 1/3 reviewers | Keep original severity |

**Important:** Consensus can only escalate severity, never reduce it. If one reviewer says Critical and two say Minor, it stays Critical.

### Step 4: Group into Workstreams

Cluster issues by theme:

| Theme | What belongs here |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Identification & Methodology** | Research design, estimation strategy, assumptions, causal claims |
| **Mathematical Rigour** | Derivations, proofs, notation consistency, formal claims |
| **Empirical Analysis** | Data, results, robustness, replication |
| **Literature & Positioning** | Citations, positioning, literature gaps, framing |
| **Presentation & Structure** | Writing quality, organisation, clarity, flow |
| **Technical (LaTeX)** | Compilation, references, formatting, figures, tables |

Within each workstream, sort by priority (Critical → Major → Minor).

### Step 5: Output Synthesis Report

Write to `reviews/<scope>/synthesise-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md` in the project, where `<scope>` is the paper slug (e.g. `paper-jtp`) or `_project` for project-level synthesis. This report contains the consolidated revision plan synthesised from all input reports.

```markdown
# Revision Plan

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reports synthesised:** [list of report files with dates]
**Total issues:** N (C: X, M: Y, m: Z)

## Positive Consensus

Issues/strengths noted positively by multiple reviewers:

- [Strength 1] — noted by [reviewers]
- [Strength 2] — noted by [reviewers]

## Workstream 1: [Theme Name]

| # | Priority | Issue | Flagged by | Action | Source |
|---|----------|-------|------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Critical | [description] | paper-critic (C1), domain-reviewer (A2), referee2 | [suggested action] | [file:line] |
| 2 | Major | [description] | paper-critic (M3), domain-reviewer (D1) | [suggested action] | [file:line] |
| 3 | Minor | [description] | paper-critic (m2) | [suggested action] | [file:line] |

## Workstream 2: [Theme Name]

[Same table format]

...

## Summary

| Workstream | Critical | Major | Minor | Total |
|------------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Identification & Methodology | X | Y | Z | N |
| Mathematical Rigour | X | Y | Z | N |
| ... | | | | |
| **Total** | **X** | **Y** | **Z** | **N** |

## Recommended Order

1. [First workstream to tackle and why]
2. [Second workstream]
3. ...

## Consensus Statistics

- Issues confirmed by all reviewers: N
- Issues confirmed by majority (2/3): N
- Issues from single reviewer: N
- Total unique issues: N
```

### Step 6: Optionally Output REPLY-TO-REVIEWERS.md

If the reviews include processed referee comments (from `/strategic-revision`), also generate:

```markdown
# Reply to Reviewers

**Paper:** [title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Reviewer 1

### Comment R1-C1: [short title]

> [Original comment — blockquote]

**Response:**
[Placeholder — to be filled by author]

**Changes made:**
- [Placeholder]

### Comment R1-C2: ...

## Reviewer 2

[Same format]
```

Ask the user before generating this file.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Do NOT run reviews** — only synthesise existing reports
- **Do NOT modify source reports** — they are read-only inputs
- **Do NOT escalate severity beyond consensus rules** — if only one reviewer flagged something, keep their severity unless it's confirmed by others
- **Do NOT invent issues** — only report what the reviewers found
- **Do NOT merge issues that are genuinely different** — only merge when the same underlying problem is described differently
