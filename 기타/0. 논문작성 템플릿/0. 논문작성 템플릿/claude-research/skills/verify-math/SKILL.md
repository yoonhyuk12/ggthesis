# Verify Math: Route a Math Claim Through the Verification Spectrum

The front door for verifying self-authored mathematics. Classify each claim, dispatch it to the strongest applicable rung(s), and merge the sub-verdicts into one report. This skill does not verify anything itself — it **routes and aggregates**; the rungs do the work.

## When to Use

- You have a Proposition / Theorem / Conjecture (or a whole paper's worth) and want it verified with the *right* method(s), possibly combined.
- `/verify-math`, "verify this theorem", "check all the math in the paper", "is this result correct".
- The operational front end of `mark-unverified`: run this before asserting a self-authored result.

## When NOT to Use

- You already know the single method → call it directly (`/numerical-check`, `/symbolic-check`, `/lean-check`, or `domain-reviewer`).
- Non-mathematical claims (citations, prose) → `/proofread`, `/bib-validate`, `domain-reviewer`.

## The verification spectrum (the rungs it routes to)

| Rung | Method | Can it… | Tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | adversarial deductive read | catch conceptual/assumption gaps (no proof) | `domain-reviewer` (agent) / `codex-math` |
| R1 | numerical falsification | **falsify** definitively; support (never prove) | `/numerical-check` |
| R2 | symbolic / CAS | **prove or falsify** an algebra step | `/symbolic-check` |
| R3 | formal Lean proof | **prove** (strongest) | `/lean-check` |

## Procedure

### 1. Decompose the result into atomic claims

A theorem is usually several obligations. List each separately: the algebra steps, the distributional/parameter-space claims, the load-bearing lemma, the conceptual assumptions. Verify each with the rung that fits — a single "verdict" on a compound theorem hides which part is shaky.

### 2. Classify each claim → rung

| Claim shape | Rung | Route to |
|---|---|---|
| algebra / derivative / limit / closed-form identity | R2 | `/symbolic-check` |
| monotonicity / threshold / comparative-static / inequality over a parameter space (distributional, probabilistic) | R1 | `/numerical-check` |
| a critical, faithfully-formalizable lemma | R3 | `/lean-check` |
| conceptual correctness, assumption completeness, code-theory alignment | R0 | `domain-reviewer` (Task/agent) |

### 3. Order: falsify cheap → prove expensive

- **Falsify first** with the cheapest applicable rung (usually R1 numerical, or R2 for algebra). A counterexample stops the pipeline — no point proving a false claim.
- **Then prove** the survivors with a proving rung (R2 for algebra, R3 for the key lemma) if the claim is important enough to warrant a positive guarantee.
- **R0 domain-reviewer** runs across the whole result for the conceptual/assumption layer the computational rungs can't see.
- Present the routing plan (claim → rung) and, when it involves R3 (expensive) or ambiguity, confirm with the user before dispatching.

### 4. Dispatch

- Invoke each rung skill via the Skill tool (`/numerical-check`, `/symbolic-check`, `/lean-check`); dispatch `domain-reviewer` via the Agent tool (fresh context — it reviews math it didn't write, per `agents-vs-skills`).
- Each rung writes its own `reviews/<scope>/verify-<method>/…` report (shared shape).

### 5. Aggregate → one verdict

| Condition | Aggregate verdict |
|---|---|
| **Any** rung returns FALSIFIED | **FALSIFIED** (name which claim + counterexample) |
| A proving rung (R2/R3) VERIFIES the core claim, nothing falsified | **VERIFIED** (note the guarantee level: CAS vs Lean) |
| Only R1 supports (no counterexample), no proving rung | **INCONCLUSIVE (supported: no counterexample in N)** |
| Rungs couldn't decide / not formalizable | **INCONCLUSIVE** |
| Setup/toolchain failure | **ERROR** |

**Numerical alone is never VERIFIED.** Only a proving rung (R2/R3) upgrades a claim from "unfalsified" to "verified".

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't** collapse a compound theorem into one verdict — decompose; report per-obligation so the shaky step is visible.
- **Don't** report VERIFIED off R1 (numerical) alone — that's INCONCLUSIVE(supported); numerical can't prove.
- **Don't** prove before falsifying — a cheap counterexample saves an expensive Lean effort.
- **Don't** self-review the conceptual layer — dispatch `domain-reviewer` as a fresh-context agent (the session that wrote the math is blind to its own gaps).
- **Don't** skip R0 — the computational rungs verify the *math as stated*; they can't catch a wrong assumption or a statement that doesn't mean what you think.

## Output — Aggregate Verification Report

Write to `reviews/<scope>/verify-math/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md`:

```
result:   <the theorem/proposition being verified>
claims:   (one row per atomic obligation)
  - <claim 1> | rung R? | verdict | evidence/report link
  - <claim 2> | rung R? | verdict | ...
verdict:  VERIFIED (Lean|CAS) | FALSIFIED (<which claim>) | INCONCLUSIVE(supported|undecided) | ERROR
guarantee: <the weakest link — the result is only as verified as its least-verified obligation>
next:     <what to escalate — e.g. "obligation 3 unfalsified by R1; Lean-prove it (R3)">
```

## Verification (did this skill work?)

- Each atomic claim has a rung + a sub-verdict + a linked sub-report.
- The aggregate verdict follows the table (FALSIFIED dominates; VERIFIED requires a proving rung).
- The `guarantee` line names the weakest link honestly.

## Worked example — 2026-07-04 (median-collapse paper), how it would route

- Threshold `ρ* = (μ_med/μ_max)²` (closed-form identity) → **R2** `/symbolic-check` → VERIFIED.
- Prop 3.1 `d/dρ Φ(μ/√ρ) < 0` (derivative sign) → **R2** → VERIFIED.
- "Q₀(∞;ρ) monotone in ρ for all competence" (distributional monotonicity) → **R1** `/numerical-check` → **FALSIFIED** (bimodal counterexample) ⇒ aggregate FALSIFIED for that claim; conjecture removed.
- Median collapse / assumptions (conceptual) → **R0** `domain-reviewer` → substantive check.
- Aggregate: the paper's *symmetric* theorem VERIFIED (CAS); the *general* conjecture FALSIFIED (R1) — exactly the split the paper now reports.
