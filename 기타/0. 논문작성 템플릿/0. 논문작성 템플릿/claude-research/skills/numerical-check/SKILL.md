# Numerical Check: Falsify a Self-Authored Math Claim by Sweep

Empirically stress-test a mathematical claim you wrote but have not proven. The goal is **falsification**: throw many random instances at the claim and try to break it. A single genuine counterexample kills the claim; a large clean sweep is *evidence*, never proof.

## When to Use

- You wrote a **Proposition / Theorem / Conjecture** (monotonicity, threshold, comparative-static, inequality, closed-form, limit) and want to know if it's actually true before claiming it.
- `/numerical-check`, "stress-test my conjecture", "find a counterexample to X", "is Q(ρ) really monotone", "does the threshold hold for all …".
- The write-time empirical arm of the `mark-unverified` rule (self-authored math must be checked before assertion).

## When NOT to Use

| Situation | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Verify an algebra / derivative / limit / closed-form identity | `/symbolic-check` (R2) |
| Machine-prove a lemma (want a proof, not a stress-test) | `/lean-check` (R3) |
| Re-verify a computed empirical result in another language | `/cross-language-check` |
| Conceptual / assumption-completeness review | `domain-reviewer` (agent) |

## Position in the verification spectrum

**R1 — numerical falsification.** Can **FALSIFY** definitively (a confirmed counterexample refutes the claim) but can **never VERIFY** (no counterexample ≠ proof). The strongest positive result is `INCONCLUSIVE (supported): no counterexample in N draws`. Pair with `/lean-check` (R3) to *prove* the claim once it survives.

## Procedure

### 1. Formalize the claim as a predicate over a domain

Restate the claim as `P(x)` that must hold for **all** `x` in a domain `D`. Make the failure condition explicit and quantitative.
- "Q(ρ) is monotone decreasing in ρ" → `P(instance) := max_i (Q(ρ_{i+1}) − Q(ρ_i)) ≤ tol` over a ρ-grid.
- "threshold ρ* separates help/hurt" → `P := (Q<p_max) iff (ρ>ρ*)`.
- Write down the domain `D` precisely (which parameters, which ranges, which side-conditions — e.g. "mean competence > ½, dispersed").

### 2. Sample the domain to approximate the TRUE object — not finite-n atoms

**This is the step that fools people.** If the claim is about a *continuous* or *large-n limit* object, a tiny discrete instance is NOT that object — it carries finite-n artifacts (ties, atoms, degenerate medians, staircase discontinuities) that manufacture *fake* violations.
- If the claim is a large-n / continuous-distribution statement, represent each random instance with **dense sampling** (hundreds of points), so the computed quantity approximates the limit.
- Generate instances from **varied shapes** (uniform, skewed, bimodal, heavy-tailed) so the sweep is adversarial, not cherry-picked.

### 3. Evaluate on an INTERIOR grid, smoothly, with a noise-aware tolerance

- Grid the parameter on the **interior** (e.g. ρ ∈ [0.02, 0.98]); endpoints breed boundary/degeneracy artifacts.
- Prefer a **smooth** evaluation (e.g. root-find the crossing) over indicator-quadrature, which quantization-jitters and creates false steps.
- Set the violation **tolerance an order of magnitude above the numerical noise floor** (measure the floor on a case you believe holds). Too tight → false positives; too loose → misses real breaks.

### 4. Sweep, count, capture the worst — seeded

- Run over **thousands** of random instances (`uv run --no-project --with numpy --with scipy python`; **never bare `python3`**). Seed the RNG.
- Count genuine violations; **capture the worst counterexample** (the instance + violation magnitude) for reporting and for the figure.

### 5. Diagnose a surprise BEFORE trusting it

If you find violations (or a suspiciously high/low rate), **do not report the raw number yet**. Check it is not an artifact:
- Re-plot the worst case on a fine grid — is the "violation" a real interior feature, or a jump at an endpoint / a finite-n tie?
- Re-run with **denser sampling** and **odd vs even n** — does the rate persist as you approach the continuous limit? An artifact shrinks; a real effect stays.
- Only once it survives these is it real. (Document the surprise + the diagnosis — `design-before-results`.)

### 6. Characterize the violators — mechanism, not just a rate

A bare "X% violate" is weak; find *when* it breaks. Break the sweep down by instance feature (shape, skew, competence-gap, bimodality) and report the driver: "non-monotonicity is a **bimodal** phenomenon — 18% of bimodal vs ~0% unimodal." This turns a number into a result.

### 7. Emit the verification report + wire numbers if feeding a paper

Write the report (shape below). If the result feeds a LaTeX paper, emit every number via a generated macro file (`results-numbers.tex`, `no-hardcoded-results`) and keep the seeded script in `experiments/`.

## Script skeleton (adapt; keep it seeded + uv-run)

```python
# uv run --no-project --with numpy --with scipy --with matplotlib python <script>.py
import numpy as np; from scipy.stats import norm; from scipy.optimize import brentq
RNG = np.random.default_rng(0)
def quantity(instance, t):        # smooth eval of the claimed object at parameter t
    ...                           # prefer root-find over indicator-quadrature
def sweep(n_trials, nsamp):       # dense instances, interior grid, noise-aware tol
    grid = np.linspace(0.02, 0.98, 90); viol = 0; worst = (-1, None); by = {}
    for _ in range(n_trials):
        inst = draw_instance(RNG, nsamp)          # varied shapes, dense
        if not in_domain(inst): continue
        Q = np.array([quantity(inst, t) for t in grid])
        up = np.diff(Q).max()                     # violation statistic
        if up > worst[0]: worst = (up, inst)
        if up > 1e-4: viol += 1; bump(by, feature(inst))
    return viol, worst, by                        # characterize by feature
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't** test a continuous/large-n claim with tiny discrete instances — finite-n ties/atoms fabricate violations. (2026-07-04: a small-n sweep read 29%; dense sampling read the real 6%.)
- **Don't** evaluate at exact parameter endpoints — degeneracies live there.
- **Don't** set the tolerance near the numerical-noise floor (false positives) or absurdly loose (misses real breaks).
- **Don't** trust the first surprising number — diagnose artifact-vs-real first.
- **Don't** report a bare violation rate — characterize the driver.
- **Don't** claim `VERIFIED` — numerical can only FALSIFY or SUPPORT. Say "no counterexample in N draws".
- **Don't** use bare `python3` — it's blocked by the uv-only allowlist; use `uv run`.
- **Don't** confirm "clean" from a compile log or a grep alone — check the actual object (e.g. grep the rendered PDF for `??`, not the build log).

## Output — Verification Report (shared `*-check` shape)

Write to `reviews/<scope>/verify-numerical/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md`:

```
claim:    <the exact statement tested, with its domain>
method:   R1 numerical falsification (N=<trials>, nsamp=<density>, grid=<interior>, tol=<t>)
verdict:  FALSIFIED | INCONCLUSIVE (supported: no counterexample in N) | INCONCLUSIVE | ERROR
evidence: <worst counterexample instance + magnitude>  OR  <"no counterexample; sweep params">
mechanism:<what feature drives violations, if any>
reproduce: uv run --no-project --with ... python experiments/<script>.py   (seed=<s>)
```

## Verification (did this skill work?)

- The script runs seeded via `uv run` and prints a violation count + worst case.
- The verdict is one of the four values; `VERIFIED` is never emitted.
- If a paper consumes the result, numbers come from a generated macro file (nothing hand-typed).

## Worked example — 2026-07-04 (median-collapse paper)

Claim: "Q₀(∞;ρ) is monotone decreasing in ρ for all competence distributions (mean>½, dispersed)" → single-threshold conjecture.
- Naive small-n sweep: **29%** violations → suspicious; worst case was a balanced even-n council.
- Diagnosed: finite-even-n ties + endpoint staircase — an **artifact**.
- Corrected (dense sampling, interior grid, smooth root-find eval, tol=10⁻⁴): **6%** real violations, worst step +0.013.
- Characterized: non-monotonicity is a **bimodal** phenomenon (18% of bimodal vs 3/3363 unimodal).
- Verdict: **FALSIFIED** — the conjecture was removed and replaced with the characterized finding.
