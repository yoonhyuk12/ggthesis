# Bibliography Parser — PDF to .bib

**LIBRARY-FIRST RULE: ALWAYS check Paperpile membership by DOI (`paperpile lookup-by-doi`) for each parsed reference BEFORE generating new BibTeX entries.** Topic/title `search-library` is a lossy discovery aid, NOT a membership test — never tag a reference `NEW` off a title-search miss. Reuse existing library entries instead of constructing from scratch. Enforced in Phase 2.3 per [`shared/reference-resolution.md`](../shared/reference-resolution.md) § Membership Check.

**Goal:** given a PDF file, extract all cited references and produce a clean, validated `.bib` file.

## When to Use

- You have a PDF (paper, report, thesis) and need a `.bib` file for its references
- Importing references from a paper that doesn't have a companion `.bib` file
- Reconstructing a bibliography from a document with embedded `\begin{thebibliography}` or numbered references
- Converting a reference list from any format into BibTeX

## When NOT to Use

- **You already have a `.bib` file** and just need to validate it — use `/bib-validate`
- **Finding new references on a topic** — use `/literature`
- **The PDF is already in Paperpile** — export via `paperpile export-bib` instead (faster, more accurate)

## Input

A single PDF file path. The PDF should contain a bibliography, reference list, or works cited section.

## Output

A `.bib` file, located by context:

- **PDF inside a research project** (e.g. `articles/`, `paper-*/`, project root) — write to the same directory as the input PDF, named `references.bib` (per project convention). If `references.bib` already exists, ask before overwriting — offer to merge or use a different name (e.g., `extracted-refs.bib`).
- **Standalone PDF** (ad-hoc extraction with no project home — e.g. an upload in `~/.claude/uploads/`) — write to `~/vault/parsed-bibs/<slug>.bib`, where `<slug>` describes the source (e.g. `kasberger-algorithmic-cooperation-geb-2026.bib`). This is the standing location for one-off parses (established 2026-06-14). Create the folder if absent.

Any staged Paperpile-import entry (Phase 4.1) is written into a `.bib` under `.paperpile-import/` next to the output `.bib`.

---

## Phase 1: Read

### 1.1 Read the PDF

Use `/split-pdf` to read the PDF contents. This handles large PDFs by splitting into chunks. Focus on the bibliography / references section — typically the last few pages. Identify:

- Numbered reference lists (e.g., `[1] Smith, J. (2020)...`)
- APA / Harvard style reference lists
- `\bibitem` entries (if the PDF was generated from LaTeX)
- Footnote-based citations

### 1.2 Skeleton confirmation (mandatory for ≥10 references)

Before running any enrichment queries, **render the parsed reference list as a numbered table and ask the user to confirm the split is correct**. A misparsed reference list (one citation accidentally split across two rows, or two citations merged into one) makes Phase 2 spend 30+ API calls on the wrong entries — expensive in time and rate-limit budget.

```markdown
Detected N references. Confirm the split before I enrich each one:

| # | parsed reference (verbatim) |
|---|----------------------------|
| 1 | Bebchuk, L. A., Cohen, A., & Hirst, S. (2017). The agency problems of institutional investors... |
| 2 | Smith, J. (2020). Title... |
| ... | ... |

Anything wrong with the split? (Reply "ok" to proceed, or list the row numbers that need merging/splitting.)
```

Skip the confirmation step if any of these:

- Fewer than 10 references parsed (cheap to fix after the fact)
- The PDF was generated from LaTeX and `\bibitem` boundaries are unambiguous
- The user explicitly said "just go" / "no confirmation"

When the user flags a bad split, fix it and re-render the skeleton before proceeding. Don't proceed to Phase 2 with unaddressed split issues — that's exactly the failure case this gate prevents.

---

## Phase 2: Enrich

### 2.1 Extract reference metadata

For each reference found, extract:

| Field | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Authors** | Required | Full names, `{Last, First and Last, First}` BibTeX format |
| **Title** | Required | Exact title from the reference |
| **Year** | Required | Publication year |
| **Journal / Booktitle** | Required (articles/proceedings) | Full journal name, not abbreviation |
| **Volume / Number / Pages** | If available | Standard bibliographic fields |
| **Publisher** | If available | For books and proceedings |
| **DOI** | Best effort | Extract if printed in the reference |

**Large reference lists (50+ entries):** process in batches of ~20. Verify each batch before moving to the next. Report progress: "Processed 20/87 references...". This caps the rate-limit blast radius if a batch fails.

### 2.2 Verify and enrich

For each extracted reference, verify and enrich using available tools:

1. **Search by title** via `WebSearch` to confirm the reference exists and pull missing metadata (DOI, volume, pages).
2. **Use the `scholarly` CLI** for multi-source enrichment:
   - `scholarly scholarly-search "<title>" --json` — search by title across OpenAlex + S2 + Scopus + WoS
   - `scholarly scholarly-paper-detail <paper_id> --json` — get full metadata including pre-formatted BibTeX (`citationStyles`), TLDR summary, and open access PDF link. When BibTeX is available, use it as the primary template instead of manually constructing entries — reduces formatting errors.
   - `scholarly openalex-lookup-doi <doi> --json` — get full metadata if DOI was found.
3. **Cross-check** extracted metadata against search results: confirm author names, year, fill in missing DOI/volume/pages/publisher.

**Important:** do NOT silently replace the extracted metadata with search results. If there's a conflict (e.g., different year, different spelling of author name), flag it as a `note` field in the `.bib` entry and keep the original from the PDF.

### 2.3 Check Paperpile library (LIBRARY-FIRST gate)

For each parsed reference, check if it already exists in Paperpile using the resolution order from [`shared/reference-resolution.md`](../shared/reference-resolution.md):

1. **Check membership by DOI** — `paperpile lookup-by-doi --doi <DOI>` for each parsed reference (verify the DOI itself first if unsure). This is the membership test. Batch ≥6 references via one Bash sub-agent returning a merged `{doi: citekey-or-null}` map.
2. **Only for DOI-less references**, fall back to `paperpile search-library` with first-author surname + title keywords (limit ≥10) — a discovery aid, not a membership test.
3. **Match → ALREADY IN PAPERPILE**: reuse the returned Paperpile citekey, skip staging in Phase 4.1. **A confirmed DOI miss (or, for DOI-less refs, an author+title miss) → `NEW`** — never tag `NEW` off a `search-library` miss alone. Foundational classics (Simon, March, Levinthal, Cyert & March, …) are the most common false `NEW`; check them by DOI too.

**Status summary:**

| Paperpile | Status | Phase 4.1 action |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Yes | `ALREADY IN PAPERPILE` | Skip (reuse key) |
| No | `NEW` | Stage as BibTeX for Paperpile import |

**Graceful degradation:** if the `paperpile` CLI is unavailable, skip with a warning and treat all references as `NEW`.

## Phase 3: Construct

### 3.1 Generate citation keys

Better BibTeX conventions:

- Format: `{Author}{Year}-{xx}` — e.g., `Smith2020-xy`
- First author's last name, title-cased
- Four-digit year
- Two-character suffix (Better BibTeX style)
- If merging into an existing `.bib`, match the key format already in use
- For references already in Paperpile (Phase 2.3), **copy the Paperpile citekey into the entry** (do not keep the generated key) and **backfill the DOI** from Paperpile, but **keep the richer local metadata** (type, journal, volume, pages, full authors — Paperpile's `export-bib` is `@misc`/thin). Add `note = {key reconciled to Paperpile <key>}`. Full rule + first-author-match guard: [`shared/reference-resolution.md`](../shared/reference-resolution.md) § Key Reconciliation.

### 3.2 Determine entry types

| Source type | BibTeX type | Key fields |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Journal article | `@article` | author, title, journal, year, volume, number, pages |
| Conference paper | `@inproceedings` | author, title, booktitle, year, pages |
| Book | `@book` | author/editor, title, publisher, year |
| Book chapter | `@incollection` | author, title, booktitle, publisher, year, pages |
| Working paper / preprint | `@techreport` or `@unpublished` | author, title, institution/note, year |
| Thesis | `@phdthesis` or `@mastersthesis` | author, title, school, year |
| Website / online | `@misc` | author, title, howpublished, year, note |

### 3.3 Write the .bib file

Write entries to the output `.bib` file with:

- One blank line between entries
- Fields indented with 2 spaces
- Required fields first, then optional fields
- DOI field included when available
- A `note` field for any metadata conflicts or uncertainties flagged in 2.2

Example entry:

```bibtex
@article{smith2020optimal,
  author = {Smith, John and Doe, Jane},
  title = {Optimal Decision Making Under Uncertainty},
  journal = {Management Science},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {66},
  number = {3},
  pages = {1234--1256},
  doi = {10.1287/mnsc.2019.3456}
}
```

### 3.4 Quality fallbacks

Two cases that cross sub-steps:

**Poor OCR / unreadable references** (PDFs with poor text extraction, scanned documents, unusual formatting):

1. Flag references that couldn't be reliably parsed.
2. Add them as `@misc` entries with `note = {MANUAL CHECK NEEDED: ...}`.
3. Include whatever text was extracted so the user can fix it manually.

**Incomplete references** (missing key fields like year or journal):

1. Attempt to find the complete reference via web search (typically already done in 2.2).
2. If found, fill in the missing fields and add `note = {metadata enriched from web search}`.
3. If not found, write what's available and flag with `note = {INCOMPLETE: missing [field]}`.

---

## Phase 4: Validate

### 4.1 Stage for Paperpile import

Follow the filing sequence from [`shared/reference-resolution.md`](../shared/reference-resolution.md). For references marked **NEW** in Phase 2.3:

1. Present a summary table before staging:

   | # | Key | Title | Authors | Year | Status |
   |---|-----|-------|---------|------|--------|
   | 1 | Smith2020-xy | Title... | Smith, J. | 2020 | NEW — staging for import |
   | 2 | Doe2019-ab | Title... | Doe, J. | 2019 | ALREADY IN PAPERPILE (skipped) |

2. **Stage under `.paperpile-import/`** — write each new entry's BibTeX into a `.bib` under `.paperpile-import/` (Paperpile CLI is read-only; `write-bib --citekeys` only exports entries already in the library). Mark any draft cite `\CiteTodo{...}` until imported.
3. **Remind user** — "Import the staged `.bib` under `.paperpile-import/` into Paperpile to complete the sync."

**Graceful degradation:** if the `paperpile` CLI is unavailable, skip this sub-step. The `.bib` file from Phase 3.3 is still the primary output.

### 4.2 Run /bib-validate (HARD GATE)

Run `/bib-validate` on the generated `.bib` file to:

- Check for required fields
- Verify DOIs resolve correctly
- Flag any remaining issues

Surface the validation report inline in the final summary (see Report section below). Do not proceed to 4.3 if `/bib-validate` reports critical issues — fix and re-validate first.

### 4.3 Output verification (before commit)

Before any auto-commit, emit an outputs manifest and run the shared verifier per [`_shared/verify-outputs.md`](../_shared/verify-outputs.md):

1. Write manifest to `<project>/.claude/state/outputs-manifest-<UTC-timestamp>.json` listing every file this skill claims to have written, paths relative to the project root.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   python3 "$HOME/.claude/skills/_shared/verify_outputs.py" \
       --manifest "$MANIFEST" \
       --project-root "$PROJECT_ROOT"
   ```

3. If the verifier exits non-zero, **do not commit**. Surface the missing-files list and stop. The verifier logs an `error` entry to `~/.claude/ecc/skill-outcomes.jsonl`.

Closes the "hallucinated outputs" failure class (commit `b2cff75`, 2026-04-18).

## Cross-References

- [`/bib-validate`](../bib-validate/SKILL.md) — validates the generated `.bib` file (called automatically in Phase 4.2)
- [`/bib-coverage`](../bib-coverage/SKILL.md) — compare project `.bib` vs Paperpile label — find uncited papers and unfiled references
- [`/split-pdf`](../split-pdf/SKILL.md) — reads the input PDF (called in Phase 1.1)
- [`/literature`](../literature/SKILL.md) — for finding additional references beyond what's in the PDF
- [`shared/reference-resolution.md`](../shared/reference-resolution.md) — canonical lookup + filing sequence used by Phase 2.3 and Phase 4.1

## Citation Contract

<!-- paperpile-citation-contract -->
1. Paperpile is the only source of truth for committed citation keys and BibTeX metadata.
2. Before writing `\cite{key}`, verify with `paperpile get-item key` and `paperpile export-bib key`.
3. Resolve unknowns in order: DOI lookup → Paperpile substring search → `refpile` semantic search → Paperpile verify.
4. A DOI miss is **not** non-membership; continue with title/author search and refpile.
5. If unresolved, write `\CiteTodo{slug}{title/author/year/DOI hint}` — never a guessed key.
6. Drafting sub-agents must not write/edit the active `.bib`; only the orchestrator regenerates it from Paperpile exports.
7. Stage genuine new refs under `.paperpile-import/` for manual Paperpile import; don't cite until Paperpile mints the key.
8. Run `scripts/bib/citation_lint.py` before commit; zero placeholders, zero non-Paperpile keys, zero hand-authored metadata.

See `rules/paperpile-citations.md` for the full workflow.
