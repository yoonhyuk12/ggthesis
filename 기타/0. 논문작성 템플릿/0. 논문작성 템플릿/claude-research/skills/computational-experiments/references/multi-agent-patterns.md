# Multi-Agent Simulation Patterns — Core

> Patterns for multi-agent simulations where heterogeneous agents interact through a shared environment. Read during Phase 2–3 when the experiment involves multiple interacting agents.
>
> Adapted from Lopez-Lira's LLM trading simulation architecture.
>
> Infrastructure patterns (feature toggles, config hashing, simulation runner, visualization): [`multi-agent-infrastructure.md`](multi-agent-infrastructure.md)

## When to Use These Patterns

- Agents interact with each other (not just with an oracle/environment independently)
- Agent populations are heterogeneous (different types, capabilities, strategies)
- Emergent behavior is the object of study (not just individual agent performance)
- The environment has persistent state that agents collectively modify (order book, resource pool, shared space)

## Agent Composition

Define agent populations declaratively. Separate agent *type* (behavior) from agent *instance* (state).

```python
"""Agent composition: define heterogeneous populations.

Pattern: AgentType (blueprint) → AgentComposition (population spec) → instantiate().

from typing import Any


class Feature(Enum):
    """Optional capabilities that can be toggled per agent type.

    Use for ablation studies: same scenario with/without memory, messaging, etc.
    """
    MEMORY = auto()          # Agent remembers past rounds
    SOCIAL = auto()          # Agent can send/receive messages
    SELF_MODIFY = auto()     # Agent can update its own strategy
    LAST_REASONING = auto()  # Agent sees its previous reasoning


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AgentType:
    """Blueprint for a class of agents.

    name: human-readable label (e.g., "value_investor", "momentum_trader")

class AgentComposition:

    """
    types: list[AgentType]
    counts: list[int]  # parallel to types

    @property
    def total(self) -> int:
        return sum(self.counts)

    def instantiate(self, base_agent_cls, rng) -> list:
        """Create agent instances from composition spec."""
        agents = []
        agent_id = 0

                agents.append(agent)
                agent_id += 1
        return agents


# --- Preset compositions ---

def uniform_composition(types: list[AgentType], total: int) -> AgentComposition:
    """Equal distribution across all types."""
    per_type = total // len(types)
    remainder = total % len(types)
    counts = [per_type + (1 if i < remainder else 0) for i in range(len(types))]
    return AgentComposition(types=types, counts=counts)


def weighted_composition(
    types: list[AgentType], weights: list[float], total: int
) -> AgentComposition:
    """Proportional distribution. weights are normalized automatically."""
    import numpy as np
    w = np.array(weights) / sum(weights)
    counts = np.round(w * total).astype(int)

    diff = total - counts.sum()

        counts[i % len(counts)] += 1 if diff > 0 else -1
    return AgentComposition(types=types, counts=counts.tolist())
```

## Messaging Service

Simple broadcast channel for inter-agent communication. Opt-in via Feature.SOCIAL.

```python
"""Inter-agent messaging service.

Pattern: singleton broadcast channel, round-indexed, agents opt in via feature flag.
"""

from collections import defaultdict


class MessagingService:
    """Round-based broadcast messaging between agents.

    Messages are visible to all agents with SOCIAL enabled.
    No private channels — extend if needed for targeted communication.

    def __init__(self):
        self._messages: dict[int, list[dict]] = defaultdict(list)

    def send(self, round_num: int, agent_id: int, message: str) -> None:
        """Broadcast a message from an agent."""
        self._messages[round_num].append({
            "agent_id": agent_id,
            "message": message,
        })

    def get_round_messages(self, round_num: int) -> list[dict]:
        """Get all messages from a specific round."""
        return self._messages.get(round_num, [])

    def get_history(self, up_to_round: int) -> list[dict]:
        """Get all messages up to (inclusive) a given round."""
        all_msgs = []
        for r in range(1, up_to_round + 1):
            for msg in self._messages.get(r, []):
                all_msgs.append({"round": r, **msg})
        return all_msgs

    def reset(self) -> None:
        """Clear all messages (for simulation reset)."""
        self._messages.clear()


# --- Extensions (implement as needed) ---

class TopicMessagingService(MessagingService):
    """Extension: topic-based channels (e.g., #market, #strategy).

    # TODO: implement if private/topic-scoped messaging is needed.
    """
    pass
```

## Multi-Level Evaluation Metrics

Agent-level + system-level + emergent metrics. The key insight: in multi-agent systems, individual performance alone is insufficient — you need metrics at multiple levels of analysis.

```python
"""Multi-level metrics for multi-agent simulations.

Three levels:
1. Agent-level: individual performance (wealth, accuracy, utility)
2. System-level: aggregate outcomes (efficiency, volume, inequality)
3. Emergent-level: patterns that arise from interaction (herding, bubbles, convergence)
