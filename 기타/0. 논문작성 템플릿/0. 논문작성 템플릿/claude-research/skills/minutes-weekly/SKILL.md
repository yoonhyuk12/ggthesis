# /minutes weekly

Synthesize an entire week of meetings and voice memos into a forward-looking brief — themes, decision arcs, stale commitments, and what deserves attention Monday.

## How it works

This is a synthesis skill, not a command wrapper. It reads across all meetings, cross-references decisions and action items, and produces an intelligence brief.

### Phase 1: Gather this week's recordings

```bash
minutes list --limit 50
```

Filter to recordings from the last 7 days by checking the `date` field in each result's frontmatter. Do NOT use `minutes search` with a date string as the query — that searches file content, not dates.

For each recording from the past 7 days, read the full file with `Read` to get content.

**If zero recordings this week:**
Say: "No recordings found for the past 7 days. Nothing to synthesize."
Offer: "Want me to look at the past 2 weeks instead?"
Do NOT hallucinate a weekly summary.

**If only 1-2 recordings:**
Still produce the brief — it's shorter but still valuable. Note: "Light week — only [N] recordings."

### Phase 2: Theme extraction

Identify the 3-5 dominant themes across all meetings this week. A theme is a topic that appeared in 2+ meetings.

For each theme:
- Which meetings discussed it
- How the conversation evolved across meetings
- Whether a resolution was reached

Present as:

```
## This Week's Themes

### 1. Pricing (3 meetings)
- Mon: Case proposed $599 baseline
- Wed: Alex pushed back to annual billing
- Fri: Agreed on monthly billing experiment
- Status: RESOLVED (after 3 discussions)

### 2. Q2 Roadmap (2 meetings)
- Tue: Committed to April ship date
- Thu: Discussed pushing to May
- Status: CONFLICTING — not reconciled
```

### Phase 3: Decision evolution arcs

For every decision made this week, search for prior decisions on the same topic in the last 30 days:

```bash
minutes search "<topic>" --since <30-days-ago> --limit 20
```

Classify each decision:

- **STABLE** — Decision held across 2+ mentions → "Locked in"
- **VOLATILE** — Changed 2+ times in 14 days → "Still in flux"
- **CONFLICTING** — Two active contradictory decisions → "Needs reconciliation"
- **NEW** — First time this topic was decided → "Fresh"

Present as a table:

```
## Decision Arcs

| Decision | Status | Arc | Last Meeting |
|----------|--------|-----|-------------|
| Pricing: monthly billing experiment | VOLATILE | $599→annual billing→monthly billing | Fri w/ Alex |
| Hire senior eng by Q2 | STABLE | Set Mar 10, held | Tue w/ Case |
| Q2 ship date | CONFLICTING | April vs May | Thu w/ team |
```

If there are CONFLICTING decisions, flag them prominently:
"⚠️ You have conflicting decisions on Q2 ship date. Monday is a good time to reconcile."

### Phase 4: Action item audit

Scan all meetings from the past 30 days for action items:

```bash
minutes actions
```

Or grep across meeting frontmatter for `action_items` with `status: open`.

Categorize:
- **Completed this week** — items that were marked done
- **Still open, on track** — items with future due dates
- **Overdue** — items with past due dates, still open
- **Assigned to others** — items others owe the user

Flag overdue items prominently:
"⚠️ 3 action items are overdue. The oldest is from Mar 10 (pricing doc for Alex)."

### Phase 5: Unresolved preps

Scan `~/.minutes/preps/` for prep files from this week that were never followed by a debrief:

```bash
ls ~/.minutes/preps/ 2>/dev/null
```

For each prep file from the last 7 days: check if a meeting with that person occurred after the prep date. If the user prepped but never debriefed:

"You prepped for a call with Alex on Tuesday but I don't see a debrief. Did the call happen?"

This catches meetings that happened but weren't recorded, or recordings that weren't processed.

### Phase 6: Forward brief

Produce a "what deserves your attention Monday" section:

```
## Attention Monday

1. **Reconcile Q2 ship date** — April vs May is unresolved.
   Last discussed Thu with the team.

2. **Send pricing doc to Alex** — Overdue since Friday.
   She's expecting it. This is blocking.

3. **Follow up with Case on competitor grid** — He committed Mar 17.
   No update yet. Worth a ping.
```

Prioritize by: CONFLICTING decisions > overdue action items > open commitments > unresolved preps.

### Phase 7: Closing ritual

End with three beats:

1. **Signal reflection** — Reference a pattern or insight from the week.
   "Pricing dominated this week — 3 meetings, 3 changes, one resolution. That's behind you now."

2. **Assignment** — The single most important thing to do Monday.
   "First thing Monday: send the pricing doc to Alex. It's overdue and she's waiting."

3. **Next skill nudge** — "For your most important meeting Monday, run `/minutes prep` to go in prepared."

## Gotchas

- **Zero recordings is not an error** — Say "nothing this week" clearly. Don't hallucinate a summary. Offer to extend the range.
- **Light weeks (1-2 recordings) are still worth summarizing** — A single meeting can have important decisions. Don't dismiss it.
- **Don't be a nag about overdue items** — Surface them factually. "This is overdue since Friday" not "You really need to get on this."
- **Decision evolution spans beyond this week** — Search the last 30 days for related decisions, not just this week. A decision made today might conflict with one from 3 weeks ago.
- **Preps without recordings might be intentional** — Maybe the meeting was cancelled. Ask, don't assume.
- **Voice memos count** — Include `~/vault/meetings/memos/` in the weekly scan. Ideas captured on the go are easy to forget.
- **End-of-week timing** — The user might run this Thursday or Monday morning. "This week" should be the most recent 7 days, regardless of day-of-week.
