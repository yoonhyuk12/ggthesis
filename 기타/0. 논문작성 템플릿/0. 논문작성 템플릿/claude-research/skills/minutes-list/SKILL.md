name: minutes-list
description: List recent meetings and voice memos. Use when the user asks "what meetings did I have", "show my recent recordings", "any meetings today", "list my voice memos", or wants an overview of their meeting history. Also use when they need to find a specific meeting by browsing rather than searching.
user_invocable: true

# /minutes list

Show recent meetings and voice memos, sorted newest-first.

## Usage

```bash
# List last 10 recordings (default)
minutes list

# Show more
minutes list --limit 20

# Only voice memos
minutes list -t memo

# Only meetings
minutes list -t meeting
```

## Output

Human-readable list to stderr, JSON array to stdout. Each entry has:
- `title`, `date`, `content_type`, `path`

To read a specific meeting's full transcript, use `Read` on its `path`.

## Gotchas

- **Returns nothing on first use** — If `~/vault/meetings/` doesn't exist yet or has no `.md` files, list returns an empty array. This is normal before the first recording.
- **JSON goes to stdout, human-readable to stderr** — If you pipe the output (e.g., `minutes list | jq`), you get JSON only. The human-readable table goes to stderr.
- **In-progress recordings don't appear** — List only shows completed, processed recordings. Use `minutes status` to check if something is currently recording.
- **Sorted by date in frontmatter, not file modification time** — If you manually edit a meeting file, it won't change its position in the list.
