description: Generate a daily digest of today's meetings and voice memos — key decisions, action items, and themes across all recordings. Use when the user asks "recap my day", "what happened in my meetings today", "daily summary", "what did I discuss today", "any action items from today", or wants a consolidated view of the day's conversations.

# /minutes recap

Synthesize all of today's meetings and voice memos into a single daily brief.

## How to generate the recap

1. **Find today's recordings** using the `/minutes search` skill:
   ```bash
   minutes search "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" --limit 50
   ```

2. **Read each meeting file** using `Read` on the paths returned

3. **Synthesize into a daily brief** — use the template in `templates/daily-recap.md` as a starting point, adapting sections based on what actually exists in the day's recordings.

4. Present the recap directly in the conversation — don't save it to a file unless asked.

## What makes a good recap

- **Cross-reference** across meetings: if pricing came up in two different calls, note that
- **Surface conflicts**: if Meeting A decided X but Meeting B discussed doing Y, flag it
- **Prioritize action items**: these are the things the user needs to act on
- **Include voice memos**: ideas captured on the go are easy to forget — surface them
- If there are no meetings or memos today, say so clearly rather than making something up

## Interactive conflict detection

When you find conflicts between meetings (e.g., different decisions on the same topic, contradictory action items, or shifted priorities), don't just note them — ask the user about them.

Use AskUserQuestion: "I found a conflict between your meetings today: [Meeting A] decided [X], but [Meeting B] discussed doing [Y]. Which one is current?"

Options should include:
- The decision from Meeting A
- The decision from Meeting B
- "Neither — it's still unresolved"
- "Both are valid in different contexts"

This turns the recap from a passive report into an active reconciliation tool. Surface at most 2-3 conflicts per recap to avoid fatigue.

## Gotchas

- **No recordings today ≠ an error** — If there are no meetings or memos for today, say "No recordings found for today" and offer to search a different date range. Don't hallucinate a recap.
- **Voice memos are easy to miss** — They live in `~/vault/meetings/memos/`, not the main `~/vault/meetings/` directory. The search command includes both, but double-check if the user says "I recorded a voice memo today" and you don't see it.
- **Meetings without LLM summarization have less structure** — If a meeting file only has a raw transcript (no Summary, Decisions, or Action Items sections), you'll need to extract insights yourself from the transcript text. Check the YAML frontmatter for `action_items:` and `decisions:` fields.
- **Cross-day meetings** — A meeting that started at 11 PM and ended at 1 AM will be dated by its start time. If the user asks "what happened today" and is missing a late-night meeting, check yesterday's date too.
